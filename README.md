# Tree Canopy Height Maps
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p>A place to create and share code of newly made maps of canopy tree heights.</p>

<p>Meta and the World Resources Institute launched a global map of tree canopy height at a 1-meter resolution, allowing the detection of single trees on a global scale. Both the canopy height data and the models used to create the data are free and publicly available (Tolan, Couprie, et al. 2024). The maps were created using machine learning models on high-resolution worldwide Maxar satellite imagery. The details of the model used to create the data set are described in Tolan et al. (2024).</p>

<h1>Working With RStudio</h1>

<p>Download R/RStudio at this link: https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop </p>


<h2>GitHub Resources</h2>

<p>A great resource for using basemaps in R to produce the interactive maps using Leaflet, Carto, and TESS-Laboratories:</p> 

Leaflet:              https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet

Carto:                https://github.com/CartoDB/basemap-styles

TESS-Laboratories:    https://github.com/TESS-Laboratory/chmloader

<h2>Docker</h2>
Docker is a uniqiue software in that it allows for you to create a containerized fully unbreakable proof since the code is contained with a single image.  

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

Make a directory and then clone the environment.

In Terminal:
`mkdir globalTreeHeight && git clone https://github.com/geodegarmo/treeHeightMaps_R.git`
